title: Choose a text editor
description: >
  We don't care what text editor you use. However, we do have some suggestions.
  Other people in the office have used [atom](https://atom.io/), [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)...
  and [Vim](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vim/vim_introduction.htm). Vim is already installed on your laptop,
  so if you'd like a quick introduction, type `vimtutor` in your terminal.
